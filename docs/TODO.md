## A deterministic check that every declared input is actually required

**Want:** a tool that, for each package in `pkgs/`, proves each entry in its argument list is
load-bearing — and fails when one is not.

**Why:** nothing currently catches a dependency that is declared but unused. `qe-tools` carried
`xmlschema` through several sessions; it is neither in upstream's `dependencies` at the packaged
tag nor imported anywhere in the 2.x source. It came from reading the wrong version's metadata,
and no check noticed. The same class of error runs the other way too: `qe-tools` was *missing*
`scipy`, which `pythonRuntimeDepsCheckHook` did catch, but only at build time and only because
upstream declared it.

So there are two directions, and only one is covered today:

| | declared but unused | used but undeclared |
|---|---|---|
| Runtime deps | **nothing checks this** | `pythonRuntimeDepsCheckHook`, at build time |
| Check inputs | **nothing checks this** | test failure, at build time |

**Shape it might take.** The honest version is a rebuild bisection: drop one input, rebuild, and
assert the build fails. That is deterministic and needs no heuristics, but it is `O(inputs)` full
builds per package, so it belongs in a `just` recipe run deliberately rather than in CI.

A cheap approximation worth having first: parse the derivation's argument list, then grep the
built package's source tree for each name's import spelling. It has false positives — plugins
discovered through entry points (`pytest-cases`, `pgtest`), build-system hooks, and programs
invoked via `subprocess` rather than imported (`xtb`, `crest`, `cp2k`) all look unused to a
grep — so it should report suspects, not fail a build.

**Prior art to check before writing anything:** `deptry` does exactly this for Python projects
(declared-but-unused, undeclared-but-imported, misplaced dev deps) and reads `pyproject.toml`.
`morfeus` already configures it (`[tool.deptry]` in its `pyproject.toml`). It answers the
*upstream* question rather than the Nix one, but for a repo that is almost entirely
`buildPythonPackage`, running `deptry` against each unpacked source and diffing its verdict
against our argument list would cover most of the gap for far less work than a bisection.

**Constraint:** whatever this becomes, it must not need a nix-daemon to report the
declared-but-unused direction — that is the half that can be answered from source, and the
sandbox this repo is usually developed in cannot build anything. See the `no-daemon-check` skill.
